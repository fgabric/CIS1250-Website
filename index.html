            alert("The software development process is a structured approach to creating software applications. It involves several stages, starting with gathering requirements and culminating in maintenance and ongoing support. The process typically includes gathering requirements where the developer interacts with the team to understand what the software should do. It involves identifying the problem to be solved, who will use the software, and what functionalities are needed. Software design is crucial because it transforms the gathered requirements into a detailed plan for building the software. This stage involves making decisions on how to solve the problem efficiently and effectively. In the implementation stage, the actual coding and programming of the software occur. Developers write the code according to the design specifications. The software is thoroughly tested in the testing stage to ensure it meets the specified requirements and functions correctly. Test cases are devised to validate and verify that the software performs as expected.Once the software is ready, it is either installed for clients on their systems or made available as a product. Maintenance involves ongoing support, bug fixes, and updates. Software design is important in the software development process to ensure a proper plan to complete the task. It serves as the bridge between the problem definition (requirements gathering) and the actual implementation. A well-designed software system is more likely to be efficient, maintainable, and less error-prone. It helps ensure that the software meets the needs of the users, is scalable for future changes, and can be easily maintained and extended. One example of well-designed software that I have personally used is Adobe Photoshop. Adobe Photoshop is a graphic design and image editing software that excels in functionality. Its design focuses on providing a comprehensive set of tools for users while also being accessible to beginners. The user interface is intuitive, with features logically organized, making it easy for users to find and use the tools they need. Additionally, Photoshop allows for customization, enabling users to tailor their workspace to their preferences. The software's continuous updates and support demonstrate Adobe's commitment to maintaining and improving the product, ensuring it remains a reliable choice for photo edits worldwide. The thoughtfully designed interface and robust features make Adobe Photoshop an excellent example of software design in action, providing a positive user experience while meeting the diverse needs of its user base.");

            alert("The requirements gathering stage in software development is an important step aimed at defining the blueprint for the entire project. These requirements serve as the foundation upon which the entire project is built upon. The significance of this stage addresses the challenge of balancing competing requirements and ensures that design and development cannot proceed without a solid understanding of these requirements. Good requirements, which define users, non standard terms, user terms, categorize, prioritize, and flow logically, provide the necessities for effective/efficient software development. Furthermore, the transition from user stories to requirements helps bridge the gap between user needs and technical specifications. User stories, such as As a student, I want to see course announcements on the main page of the course website so that I can see the announcements first, are translated into detailed requirements like The student must be able to see the course announcements on the main page of the course website. Finally, following guidelines such as defining a standard document structure, making documents easy to change, uniquely identifying each requirement, and conducting requirements inspections ensures that the gathered requirements are of high quality and free from contradictions.");

            alert("Empathy is a component of successful business models, and it entails the ability to comprehend and vicariously engage with the emotions, thoughts, and experiences of others without explicit communication. It stands apart from sympathy, which can inadvertently create emotional distance rather than fostering genuine understanding. In the realm of business models, empathy assumes a pivotal role in addressing the limitations of three models.The first of these is the Consumers as Profit-Seekers model, which perceives customers as profit generators for businesses. This perspective lacks empathy as it reduces customers to mere instruments of financial gain, failing to acknowledge their multifaceted lives and experiences.The Sheep Model portrays customers as easily influenced individuals who blindly follow trends and marketing messages. This model lacks empathy by disregarding the intricacies of human behavior and motivation, wrongly assuming a passive audience.The final model, Homo Economicus, states customers make rational decisions to maximize their utility, often vaguely defined as happiness or satisfaction. This model's empathy deficit lies in its fixation on quantifiable metrics like ROI and efficiency while neglecting the emotional and subjective facets of customer experiences. All three of these outdated models fall short in terms of empathy because they fail to perceive customers beyond their immediate roles as profit sources, trend followers, or rational decision-makers. Genuine empathy transcends these limited viewpoints to recognize the multifaceted nature of customers' lives, emotions, motivations, and experiences.By embracing empathy, businesses can forge stronger connections with their customers, gain a deeper understanding of their needs, and develop products/services that resonate with the diversity of their realities. Empathy acts as the bridge enabling organizations to move beyond antiquated models and cultivate a more profound and authentic comprehension of their customers. This shift towards customer-centricity is essential for achieving success in the dynamic landscape of contemporary business.");

Among the primary users are senior citizens, many of whom have difficulty getting in and out of chairs due to reduced strength and flexibility. For these individuals, the Seat Lifter offers a practical and user-friendly solution, helping them maintain their independence and enjoy the comfort of their favorite armchair or sofa. Gerald is an 82 year old retired factory worker who lives in an assisted living community and has a single marital status. He lives in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan and makes no income as he is living off of retirement savings. His home is practical as he requires assistance in his day to day life. His approach in life is selective and he improvises in his day to day life to deal with challenges due to his work related injuries he has sustained over his career.

            alert("	Effective communication is important in software design, influencing every stage of development. In the Requirements Stage, software engineers must communicate with clients to understand their needs, write comprehensive requirements documents, and continuously iterate to ensure alignment. During the Design Stage, a collaborative effort is required to answer the "How" question, create prototypes, and run usability studies while documenting designs and iterating as needed. Technical reviews and brainstorming sessions facilitate innovation and problem-solving. To excel in communication, you must listen actively, be open and empathetic, stay mindful and attentive, and learn to adapt flexibly while being culturally sensitive and avoiding undue pressure. Being positive, honest, and fair fosters trust and effective collaboration.In a personal experience, I encountered a communication issue during a brainstorming session where team members were not open to unconventional ideas. Reflecting on what I've learned, I could have taken a more active role in setting a positive tone by welcoming unusual ideas and encouraging a suspension of assumptions. I could have also suggested specific brainstorming rules to reduce social inhibitions and stimulate creative thinking. This would have allowed us to harness the full potential of our team's creativity and generate a wider range of innovative solutions for the problem at hand. Effective communication is not just about talking but also about creating an environment where diverse ideas can flourish.");
