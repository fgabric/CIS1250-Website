<p><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The software development process is a structured approach to creating software<br />applications. It involves several stages, starting with gathering requirements and<br />culminating in maintenance and ongoing support. The process typically includes<br />gathering requirements where the developer interacts with the team to understand what<br />the software should do. It involves identifying the problem to be solved, who will use the<br />software, and what functionalities are needed. Software design is crucial because it<br />transforms the gathered requirements into a detailed plan for building the software. This<br />stage involves making decisions on how to solve the problem efficiently and effectively.<br />In the implementation stage, the actual coding and programming of the software occur.<br />Developers write the code according to the design specifications. The software is<br />thoroughly tested in the testing stage to ensure it meets the specified requirements and<br />functions correctly. Test cases are devised to validate and verify that the software<br />performs as expected.Once the software is ready, it is either installed for clients on their<br />systems or made available as a product. Maintenance involves ongoing support, bug<br />fixes, and updates.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Software design is important in the software development process to ensure a<br />proper plan to complete the task. It serves as the bridge between the problem definition<br />(requirements gathering) and the actual implementation. A well-designed software<br />system is more likely to be efficient, maintainable, and less error-prone. It helps ensure<br />that the software meets the needs of the users, is scalable for future changes, and can<br />be easily maintained and extended.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; One example of well-designed software that I have personally used is Adobe<br />Photoshop. Adobe Photoshop is a graphic design and image editing software that<br />excels in functionality. Its design focuses on providing a comprehensive set of tools for<br />users while also being accessible to beginners. The user interface is intuitive, with<br />features logically organized, making it easy for users to find and use the tools they<br />need. Additionally, Photoshop allows for customization, enabling users to tailor their<br />workspace to their preferences. The software's continuous updates and support<br />demonstrate Adobe's commitment to maintaining and improving the product, ensuring it<br />remains a reliable choice for photo edits worldwide. The thoughtfully designed interface<br />and robust features make Adobe Photoshop an excellent example of software design in<br />action, providing a positive user experience while meeting the diverse needs of its user<br />base.</p>

<p><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The requirements gathering stage in software development is an important step<br />aimed at defining the blueprint for the entire project. These requirements serve as the<br />foundation upon which the entire project is built upon. The significance of this stage<br />addresses the challenge of balancing competing requirements and ensures that design<br />and development cannot proceed without a solid understanding of these requirements.<br />Good requirements, which define users, non standard terms, user terms, categorize,<br />prioritize, and flow logically, provide the necessities for effective/efficient software<br />development. Furthermore, the transition from user stories to requirements helps bridge<br />the gap between user needs and technical specifications. User stories, such as "As a<br />student, I want to see course announcements on the main page of the course website<br />so that I can see the announcements first," are translated into detailed requirements like<br />"The student must be able to see the course announcements on the main page of the<br />course website." Finally, following guidelines such as defining a standard document<br />structure, making documents easy to change, uniquely identifying each requirement,<br />and conducting requirements inspections ensures that the gathered requirements are of<br />high quality and free from contradictions.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><br /><strong>5 User Stories for Adobe Photoshop</strong></h3>
<p><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; As a graphics designer, I want the ability to see all my layers quickly, so that I can<br />navigate my project without scrolling through a bunch of layers so I can complete tasks<br />in a faster manner.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; As an artist, I want the ability to switch into a drawing mode, so that I can<br />navigate photoshop efficiently as there are alot of tools visible not in use which can<br />make it confusing on which tool to use next.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; As a photo editor, I want a brush tool that allows me to patch areas of the photo<br />with AI generated content which matches the surrounding layers, so that I can have<br />more realistic graphics to fill in the area that I want to change as opposed to blending<br />random surrounding pixels together.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; As a photographer, I want a tool which allows me to remove backgrounds, so that<br />I can operate more efficiently as opposed to masking out backgrounds as it is very time<br />consuming.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; As a teacher, I want photo examples of tool functionality when chosen, so that<br />my students know what the specific tool does on the photo visually before using it.</p>
